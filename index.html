        <h1>University Student News Consumption Behaviour</h1>
        <p class="tagline">
            An exploratory study using large language models (LLMs) to simulate how university students consume, trust, and verify digital news.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>In the contemporary digital environment, university students receive news continuously through social media,
      news apps, and other online platforms. Their news consumption habits can shape academic performance, critical
      thinking, civic engagement, and long‑term decision‑making.</p>
      <p>This project investigates how university students consume and evaluate digital news, focusing on frequency of
      news use, trust in different sources, verification strategies, and the perceived impact of algorithms and
      misinformation. Large language models (LLMs) are prompted to “pretend” to be university students and complete a
      structured questionnaire, allowing comparison of simulated student behaviours across models.</p>
      <h3>Research Questions</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>How frequently do (simulated) university students consume news, and through which channels?</li>
          <li>What factors influence their trust in news sources and their verification practices?</li>
          <li>How do social media algorithms and digital platforms appear to shape their news exposure and perspectives in the LLM‑simulated responses?</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Method</h2>
      <h3>Questionnaire Design</h3>
      <p>A 20‑item questionnaire was developed to capture key aspects of university students’ news behaviour, including:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><span>Background:</span> field of study and current student status (e.g. first‑year undergraduate, postgraduate).</li>
          <li><span>News habits:</span> frequency of actively seeking news, time spent per day, and primary news sources (social media, news websites/apps, TV, peers, others).</li>
          <li><span>Trust and verification:</span> trust in mainstream media organisations, frequency of verifying news, and factors influencing trust (academic credibility, transparency, recommendations, peer consensus, personal alignment).</li>
          <li><span>Digital environment:</span> accidental exposure to news on social media, perceived impact of algorithmic curation, preferred types of news content, and importance of visual elements.</li>
          <li><span>Misinformation and concerns:</span> confidence in identifying misinformation, methods of checking credibility, changes in news consumption, avoidance of news, reactions to conflicting reports, and concerns about the future of digital news media.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Most questions used multiple‑choice options A–E to make responses easy to compare and visualise.</p>
      <h3>LLM Data Collection</h3>
      <p>The questionnaire was given to multiple LLMs. Each model received instructions such as:
      “Pretend to be a university student. Answer the following questions. Use only options A–E where specified.”</p>
      <p>Example items include:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>“Only answer the programme name: What is your field of study?”</li>
          <p><span>Response Sample:</span> Computer Science</p>
          <li>“How frequently do you actively seek out news? A: Multiple times daily B: Once daily C: Several times weekly D: Once weekly E: Rarely.”</li>
          <p><span>Response Sample:</span> B (Once daily)</p>
      </ul>
    </section>

  <section id="results">
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <h3>1. News Consumption Frequency and Sources</h3>
    <p>Most simulated students reported checking news at least several times per week, with many selecting “once daily”
      or “multiple times daily”. Social media and news websites/apps were consistently chosen as the primary sources,
      while TV and peers were less frequent.</p>
    <img>
    <p>This suggests that news is integrated into everyday routines and is accessed mainly through digital channels,
      consistent with survey findings about young adults’ reliance on online and social platforms for news.</p>
    <h3>2. Trust in Mainstream Media</h3>
    <p>Across models, trust in mainstream media tends to cluster around “some distrust” and “neutral”, with a relatively
      small share of responses expressing unqualified trust. This mirrors widely reported skepticism among younger
      audiences and raises questions about how students decide which sources to rely on.</p>
    <img>
      <h3>3. Verification Strategies</h3>
    <p>In the simulated responses:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>“Multiple source comparison” appeared frequently as a preferred verification method.</li>
      <li>Academic sources, official fact‑checking websites, and consultation with peers/professors were less common.</li>
      <li>A small minority of responses selected “I do not verify news”.</li>
    </ul>
    <img>
    <p>This suggests that simulated students perform verification, but primarily in informal ways. They rely on
      cross‑checking different outlets or platforms rather than using more systematic methods, which has implications
      for information literacy teaching.</p>
    <h3>4. Algorithms, Misinformation, and Concerns</h3>
    <p>Many responses indicated that social media algorithms “somewhat limit” perspectives or have “no significant
      effect”, while fewer selected “greatly expands” or “greatly limits” perspectives. Misleading content was reported
      as being encountered “occasionally” or “frequently”, and concerns about misinformation and source credibility
      were often chosen as top worries about the future of digital news media.</p>

    <h2>Discussion</h2>
    <p>
      Using LLMs to simulate university students provides a low‑cost, low‑risk way to explore plausible patterns of
      news behaviour before collecting real human data. The models reproduce many trends found in empirical surveys of
      young audiences: heavy reliance on digital news, cautious or mixed trust in mainstream media, informal
      verification strategies, and concern about misinformation.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, LLM‑generated data are not a substitute for actual student responses. The patterns reflect the models’
      training data and internal biases rather than genuine attitudes. Future extensions of this project could:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Compare simulated responses with real survey results from university students.</li>
      <li>Test how different prompts change the “student” profiles produced by each model.</li>
      <li>Explore cross‑cultural or discipline‑specific differences in simulated news behaviour.</li>
    </ul>
